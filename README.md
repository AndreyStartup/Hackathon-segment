## Challenge summary

The challenge involves using data science techniques to help an investment fund identify profitable properties for investment. The dataset provided includes information on real estate properties, such as locality, estimated price, and selling price over the past 23 years. The task is to identify the relevant input features and use them to predict the sale price of a property, and then segment the properties into four categories based on their predicted gain. 

Segments:
* Premium Properties
* Valuable Properties
* Standard Properties
* Budget Properties

The goal is to submit the results at the segment level for each property in the test dataset.
